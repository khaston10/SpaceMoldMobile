# SpaceMoldMobile
A mobile game in development being made in Unity.

A mobile game where you play as Space Mold, a happy multicellular structure floating through space. Your happiness is interrupted when you realize you are on a collision course with a planet known to the locals as EARTH. The planet seems to be filled with a multitude of organisms all participating in the struggle for survival; in your current state you do not stand a chance. Time to use your mold wits, mold luck, and any other mold attribute you can find to prepare for impact!
